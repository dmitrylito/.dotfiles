"""style-guard.py — enforces the output contract in style-rules.md on every response.

Wired from ~/.claude/settings.json (hook JSON arrives on stdin):
    style-guard.py inject      UserPromptSubmit -> short reminder of the contract
    style-guard.py check       Stop             -> all checks, blocks on failure
    style-guard.py check-fast  SubagentStop     -> word/preamble patterns only

A blocked Stop is fed back to Claude as an instruction, so it must rewrite before it can
finish. Both the discarded response and the rewrite stay on screen — the terminal cannot
retract streamed text — so blocking is kept rare, and every check here is deterministic.

There used to be a Haiku judge on this path. It cost ~10s on EVERY response and could only
warn, and its whole recorded catch was two things now checked directly and more accurately:
closing_recap() measures the padding it flagged, and ungrounded_paths() resolves asserted
paths against the filesystem and the transcript rather than guessing from a truncated
excerpt. Do not reintroduce an LLM here — a Stop hook is on the critical path of every turn.

Env:
    STYLE_GUARD=0        disable everything
    STYLE_GUARD_GROUNDING=0  keep the word checks, skip path verification

`inject` deliberately does NOT re-send style-rules.md: the Terse output style already
includes that same file, so the full text is in the system prompt and sending it again each
turn paid for the same tokens twice. What ships per turn is REMINDER — the failure modes the
verdict log actually shows — while `check` still judges against the full file.

Every checked response appends one line to $XDG_STATE_HOME/claude-style-guard/verdicts.jsonl
(outcome: clean / blocked / over-cap / ungrounded). The style-tuner skill mines that log to
propose contract edits; without it the only record is whatever leaked into a transcript.

Pure stdlib, no subprocesses, no network. Runs in ~20ms.
